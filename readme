Firstly create a VM automatically that is not managed thorugh terraform
copy the instance id of the resource 

now create a resource section in main.tf file 

now run:
a) terraform import aws_instance.test instance_id 


resource "aws_instance" "test"{
    ami = ""
    instance_type = ""
}

once import worked fine. copy the ami_id and instance_type and try terraform plan
